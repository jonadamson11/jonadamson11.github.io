<p style="color:red;">Welcome to My Website!</p>
<p style="background-color:Tomato;">About Me: <br> I am a sophomore at Denison University, majoring in data analytics with a concentration in economics.
  I live in Barrington, Rhode Island and I also play football at Denison. Some of my hobbies include working out, playing video games,
  and anything that involves hanging out with my friends. My favorite TV show is Peaky Blinders on Netflix and my favorite book is The Road
  by Cormac McCarthy. <strong> Be sure to check back to my website as I update it!</strong> </p>
